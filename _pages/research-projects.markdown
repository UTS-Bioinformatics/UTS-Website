## COPD / Asthma
The RBMB lab focuses on understanding the molecular origins of COPD through mass screening approaches (Whole Exome Sequencing, RNA-Seq and Methylation) and identifying easy-to-obtain biomarkers of disease development and progression. The RBMB lab has four ongoing projects focused on COPD.

### Mechanisms of respiratory diseases in the perspective of ageing
The ageing population continues to grow and has now become a global issue. As people age, senescent (aged) cells accumulate, leading to more severe outcomes in age-related diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and susceptibility to virus infections such as COVID-19. Hao’s project involves understanding the mechanisms of cellular senescence in COPD and COVID-19 using bioinformatics and molecular assays, focusing on spatial transcriptomics. This study will provide new insights into the disease mechanisms and new therapies of COPD and COVID-19 related to ageing.


### Genetics and epigenetics of COPD and corticosteroid resistance
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide. The symptoms of COPD include increasing breathlessness, a persistent cough with phlegm, and wheezing. The pathogenic symptoms include an inflammatory response, thickened airway walls, increased mucus that block the airway and destruction of the alveoli (emphysema). Smoking is a leading cause of COPD, though a genetic defect called alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency (AATD) can also be the root cause. Treatment of COPD mainly focuses on elevating the symptoms of the disease using bronchodilators to widen the airway and corticosteroids to treat the inflammation. Jos’s project uses bioinformatics on COPD datasets from the GRIAC group in Groningen, the Netherlands, to answer questions about the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the disease and corticosteroid resistance.


## SARs-CoV-2
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To better understand COVID-19, the genetic and environmental factors on susceptibility and severity, detailed knowledge of the regulation of genes required for viral entry into respiratory epithelial cells is needed.
Using nasal and bronchial samples from nine independent cohorts, we assessed the gene expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors and activating proteases and their regulation by smoking, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), and genetics/epigenetics.


## LAM
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare cancer-like disease primarily affecting women. Infiltration of the lung parenchyma, the lung portion involved in the gas exchange, with smooth muscle-like cells resulting in cystic lung destruction, categorizes LAM. Despite the significant advances seen in the last two decades, many things about this slowly progressive disease are unknown, including but not limited to the source of the invading cells in LAM. The source of the invading cells in LAM can be due to many factors. For example, one of the most common manifestations of LAM is dyspnoea or shortness of breath, which is often initially interpreted as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This interpretation delays the diagnosis of LAM for another 3-5 years until suspicion is raised due to a lack of response to current therapies or absence of remissions or exacerbations.

The aim of the project is to

1) Identify the cellular origin, state, and trajectory by applying snRNA-seq on the tumour samples collected from LAM patients. Tumour samples have been collected from the lungs of LAM patients.

2) Create a successful knockout cell line of TSC1 and TSC2 genes using the CRISPR-cas9 gene editing tool.

3) Understand the function and drug sensitivity of the knockout cell line in differentiated lung cultures that mimic in-vivo LAM cells.



## Bioinformatics
The RBMB lab provides bioinformatic support to researchers and industrial companies worldwide. Our lab also focuses on developing new bioinformatic methods and datasets in collaboration with our international partners to better understand respiratory disease.

### Cellular deconvolution
Cellular deconvolution is a method to determine the original proportion of cell types in a sample processed for RNA-Seq. Our group has recently developed a deconvolution matrix based on single-cell sequencing data from bronchial biopsies. The cellular prediction obtained through this method strongly correlates with match samples' histology. <a href="doi.org/10.1038/s41591-023-02327-2" target="_blank">This method is publically available</a>.

### The reliability of the nose as a biomarker of the lower airways
The criterion standard in respiratory research is the investigation of biosamples of the lower airway, which are usually obtained by bronchoscopy. However, this is an invasive procedure with a substantial burden to patients that is also associated with high costs.

Recent studies have suggested that nasal brushings may provide a less invasive source of airway epithelial cells that closely approximate the bronchial airways. We conclude that the usability of nasal brushings as a marker of the bronchial epithelial gene expression and eQTLs to find noncoding risk variants can be a promising experimental approach; however, it is highly gene-dependent. We developed a comprehensive catalogue of the bronchial nasal gene correlations, which can be queried for future studies.

### Development of unique bioinformatic datasets
The unique datasets developed through the RBMB lab in collaboration with the GRIAC group, UMCG, Netherlands, have led to important findings and are currently used by several labs worldwide. These datasets are publicly available in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), promoting use by all scientists.
