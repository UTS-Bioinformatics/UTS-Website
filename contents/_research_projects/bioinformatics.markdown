### Cellular Deconvolution
Cellular deconvolution is a method to determine the original proportion of cell types in a sample processed for RNA-Seq. Our group has recently developed a deconvolution matrix based on single-cell sequencing data from bronchial biopsies. The cellular prediction obtained through this method strongly correlates with match samples' histology. <a href="doi.org/10.1038/s41591-023-02327-2" target="_blank">This method is publically available</a>.

### The reliability of the nose as a biomarker of the lower airways
The criterion standard in respiratory research is the investigation of biosamples of the lower airway, which are usually obtained by bronchoscopy. However, this is an invasive procedure with a substantial burden to patients that is also associated with high costs.

Recent studies have suggested that nasal brushings may provide a less invasive source of airway epithelial cells that closely approximate the bronchial airways. We conclude that the usability of nasal brushings as a marker of the bronchial epithelial gene expression and eQTLs to find noncoding risk variants can be a promising experimental approach; however, it is highly gene-dependent. We developed a comprehensive catalogue of the bronchial nasal gene correlations, which can be queried for future studies.

### Development of unique bioinformatic datasets
The unique datasets developed through the RBMB lab in collaboration with the GRIAC group, UMCG, Netherlands, have led to important findings and are currently used by several labs worldwide. These datasets are publicly available in NCBIâ€™s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), promoting use by all scientists.
