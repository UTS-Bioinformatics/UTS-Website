### Mechanisms of respiratory diseases in the perspective of ageing
The ageing population continues to grow and has now become a global issue. As people age, senescent (aged) cells accumulate, leading to more severe outcomes in age-related diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and susceptibility to virus infections such as COVID-19. Hao’s project involves understanding the mechanisms of cellular senescence in COPD and COVID-19 using bioinformatics and molecular assays, focusing on spatial transcriptomics. This study will provide new insights into the disease mechanisms and new therapies of COPD and COVID-19 related to ageing.

### Genetics and epigenetics of COPD and corticosteroid resistance
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide. The symptoms of COPD include increasing breathlessness, a persistent cough with phlegm, and wheezing. The pathogenic symptoms include an inflammatory response, thickened airway walls, increased mucus that block the airway and destruction of the alveoli (emphysema). Smoking is a leading cause of COPD, though a genetic defect called alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency (AATD) can also be the root cause. Treatment of COPD mainly focuses on elevating the symptoms of the disease using bronchodilators to widen the airway and corticosteroids to treat the inflammation. Jos’s project uses bioinformatics on COPD datasets from the GRIAC group in Groningen, the Netherlands, to answer questions about the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the disease and corticosteroid resistance.
