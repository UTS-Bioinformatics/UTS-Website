Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare cancer-like disease primarily affecting women. Infiltration of the lung parenchyma, the lung portion involved in the gas exchange, with smooth muscle-like cells resulting in cystic lung destruction, categorizes LAM. Despite the significant advances seen in the last two decades, many things about this slowly progressive disease are unknown, including but not limited to the source of the invading cells in LAM. The source of the invading cells in LAM can be due to many factors. For example, one of the most common manifestations of LAM is dyspnoea or shortness of breath, which is often initially interpreted as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This interpretation delays the diagnosis of LAM for another 3-5 years until suspicion is raised due to a lack of response to current therapies or absence of remissions or exacerbations.

The aim of the project is to

1) Identify the cellular origin, state, and trajectory by applying snRNA-seq on the tumour samples collected from LAM patients. Tumour samples have been collected from the lungs of LAM patients.

2) Create a successful knockout cell line of TSC1 and TSC2 genes using the CRISPR-cas9 gene editing tool.

3) Understand the function and drug sensitivity of the knockout cell line in differentiated lung cultures that mimic in-vivo LAM cells.
