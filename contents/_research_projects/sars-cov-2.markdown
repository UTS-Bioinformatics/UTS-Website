short: "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To better understand COVID-19, the genetic and environmental factors on susceptibility and severity, detailed knowledge of the regulation of genes required for viral entry into respiratory epithelial cells is needed."

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To better understand COVID-19, the genetic and environmental factors on susceptibility and severity, detailed knowledge of the regulation of genes required for viral entry into respiratory epithelial cells is needed.
Using nasal and bronchial samples from nine independent cohorts, we assessed the gene expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors and activating proteases and their regulation by smoking, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), and genetics/epigenetics.
